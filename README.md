ReBuff is a Dalamud plugin for tracking buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns in FFXIV.

This project is NOT associated with WeakAuras in any way and is not intended as a fully reatured replacement.

## How to Install

ReBuff is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed via third party repository.

Here is the URL for my plugin repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WesBosch/Rebuff/main/repo.json`

## Features

### Current Features

- Create an icon to track and buff, debuff, or cooldown.
- Extensive customization options for how your widgets should appear, including custom font support.
- Specify specific conditions for when to show an icon based on certain variables.
- Create groups to logically organize your widgets.
- Ability to create bars to track cooldowns and buffs/debuffs.
- Full support for importing and exporting widgets, so you can share what you've made.
- This *should* be backwards compatible with existing XIVAuras exports, please let me know if something is amiss!
