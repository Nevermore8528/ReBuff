A custom fork of XIVAuras.
ReBuff is a Dalamud plugin for tracking buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns in FFXIV. This project is NOT associated with WeakAuras in any way.

## How to Install

ReBuff is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed via third party repository.

Here is the URL for my plugin repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WesBosch/ReBuff/main/repo.json`
